    overview:
      "Third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to harbor life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land with remaining 70.8% is covered with water. Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive.",

    internalStructure:
      "Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle.",

    surfaceGeology:
      "The total surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2. The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.",

    name: "Jupiter",
    overview:
      "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.",
    overviewWiki: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter",
    internalStructure:
      "When the Juno arrived in 2016, it found that Jupiter has a very diffuse core that mixes into its mantle. A possible cause is an impact from a planet of about ten Earth masses a few million years after Jupiter's formation, which would have disrupted an originally solid Jovian core.",

    internalStructure:
      "Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials. Scientists initially determined that the core is at least partially liquid. Current models of its interior imply a core consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16–17% sulfur.",

    name: "Neptune",
    overview:
      "Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, more massive than its near-twin Uranus.",

      "Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions.",

    overviewWiki: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn",
    internalStructure:
      "Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass.",

    overviewWiki: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus",
    internalStructure:
      "The standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/iron–nickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope. The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55 Earth masses.",

    overviewWiki: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus",
    internalStructure:
      "The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate.",
